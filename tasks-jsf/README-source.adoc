== What is it?

The `tasks-jsf` quickstart demonstrates how to use JPA persistence with JSF as view layer in an application deployed to {productNameFull}.

The theme of this application is simple Task management with simple login. The project contains two entities - a `user` and a `task`.

This sample includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. Persistence code is covered by tests to help you write business logic without the need to use any view layer.

JSF is used to present the user two views.

* authentication form: This provides the simple login
* task view: This view contains the task list, a task detail, and a task addition form. The task view uses AJAX.
