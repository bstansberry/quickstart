to a PostgreSQL database also hosted on OpenShift.

== What is it?

The `todo-backend` quickstart demonstrates how to implement a backend that exposes a HTTP API with `Jakarta REST`
to manage a list of ToDo which are persisted in a database with `Jakarta Data`.

* The backend exposes a HTTP API to manage a list of todos that complies with the specs defined at https://todobackend.com/specs/index.html[todobackend.com].
* It requires a connection to a PostgreSQL database to persist the todos.
ifndef::ProductRelease[]
* It uses the Server Provisioning for local and cloud deployment
endif::[]
* It can be build with {productName} S2I images for cloud deployment
ifndef::ProductRelease[]
* It is deployed on OpenShift using the https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/[Helm Chart for {productName}].
endif::[]
ifdef::ProductRelease[]
* It is deployed on OpenShift using the https://jbossas.github.io/eap-charts//[Helm Chart for {productName}].

== Architecture

=== Architecture with S2I

This backend is built using {productName} S2I Builder and Runtime images. 

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
When the image is built, `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin` plugin provisions the {productName} application server and all the feature packs it needs for its features.
The layers are defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` section of the `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin` plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<layers>
  <layer>cloud-server</layer>
  <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer>
</layers>
----
endif::[]

ifdef::ProductRelease[]
When the image is built, `org.jboss.eap.plugins:eap-maven-plugin` plugin provisions the {productName} application server and all the feature packs it needs for its features.
The layers are defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` section of the `org.jboss.eap.plugins:eap-maven-plugin` plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<layers>
  <layer>cloud-server</layer>
  <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer>
</layers>
----
endif::[]

The `cloud-server` layer provides everything needed to run the backend on OpenShift. This also includes access to
Jakarta EE APIs such as CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, etc. These two layers comes from the {productName} feature pack provided in the
{productName} S2I builder image.

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
The `postgresql-datasource` layer provides a JDBC driver and DataSource to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It is also provided by
`org.wildfly:wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack` which is included in the WildFly S2I image.

The Git repository for this feature pack is hosted at https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack.
It provides JDBC drivers and datasources for different databases but for this quickstart, we will only need the `postgresql-datasource`.
endif::[]

ifdef::ProductRelease[]
The `postgresql-datasource` layer provides a JDBC driver and DataSource to connect to a PostgreSQL database. It is also provided by
the `org.jboss.eap:eap-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.

The Git repository for this feature pack is hosted at https://github.com/jbossas/eap-datasources-galleon-pack.
It provides JDBC drivers and datasources for different databases but for this quickstart, we will only need the `postgresql-datasource`.
endif::[]

=== Connection to the PostgreSQL database

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
As mentioned, the JDBC drivers and datasource configuration that the backend uses to connect to the PostgreSQL database
is provided by the `org.wildfly:wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.
endif::[]
ifdef::ProductRelease[]
As mentioned, the JDBC drivers and datasource configuration that the backend uses to connect to the PostgreSQL database
is provided by the `org.jboss.eap:eap-datasources-galleon-pack` feature pack.
endif::[]

By default, it exposes a single datasource.
In the backend, the name of this datasource is `ToDoRepository` and is specified in the `persistence.xml` to configure JPA:

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="primary">
  <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/ToDos</jta-data-source>
</persistence-unit>
----

At runtime, we only need a few environment variables to establish the connection from {productName} to the external PostgreSQL database:

* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE` - the name of the database (that will be called `todos`)
* `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST` - the host to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT` - The port to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_USER` & `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` - the credentials to connect to the database
* `POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE` - The name of the datasources (as mentioned above, it will be `ToDoRepository`)

=== Filters for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The Web frontend for this quickstart uses JavaScript calls to query the backend's HTTP API.
We must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filters in the `undertow` subsystem of {productName} to allow
these HTTP requests to succeed.

ifdef::ProductRelease[]
==== Configuration with {productName} S2I

As we use S2I to provision the server and build the application, we provide a CLI script that contains all the commands to create and configure the CORS filters in Undertow. This script is located in the `src/scripts/cors_filters.cli`.
endif::[]

This script is executed at build time and will provide the following HTTP headers to enabled CORS:

* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTION, PUT, DELETE, PATCH`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: accept, authorization, content-type, x-requested-with`
* `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
* `Access-Control-Max-Age: 1`

By default, the backend accepts requests from any origin (`*`). This is only simplicity. It is possible to restrict
the allowed origin using the environment variable `CORS_ORIGIN` at runtime.

== Run the Backend Locally

=== Package the Backend

The backend is packaged and deployed on a provisioned server:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package -Pprovisioned-server
----

=== Run a Local PostgreSQL Database

Before running the backend locally, we need to have a local PostgreSQL database that we can connect to.
We use the `postgresql` docker image to create one:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker run --name todo-backend-db -e POSTGRES_USER=todos -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 postgres
----

This will create a database named `todos` that we can connect to on `localhost:5432` with the credentials `todos / mysecretpassword`.

=== Run the Application

With the PostgreSQL database running, we can start the backend by passing the required environment variables to connect to the database:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ ./target/server/bin/standalone.sh -Denv.POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=todos -Denv.POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE=ToDos -Denv.POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST=localhost -Denv.POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT=5432 -Denv.POSTGRESQL_USER=todos -Denv.POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
----

The backend is running, and we can use the HTTP API to manage a list of todos:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
# get a list of todos
$ curl http://localhost:8080
[]

# create a todo with the title "This is my first todo item!"
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"title": "This is my first todo item!"}' http://localhost:8080
{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/1"}%

# get a list of todos with the one that was just created
$ curl http://localhost:8080
[{"completed":false,"id":1,"order":0,"title":"This is my first todo item!","url":"https://localhost:8080/1"}]
----

The use of a Server Provisioned deployment makes it seamless to move from a local deployment for development to a
deployment on cloud platforms such as OpenShift and Kubernetes.
