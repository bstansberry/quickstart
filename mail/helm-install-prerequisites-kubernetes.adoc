=== Install the Mail server on Kubernetes

The functionality of this quickstart depends on a running instance of the https://greenmail-mail-test.github.io/greenmail/[Greenmail Standalone server].

To deploy and configure the mail server, you will need to apply a set of configurations to your Kubernetes cluster:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
include::charts/greenmail-kubernetes.yaml[]
----

To make things simpler, you can find these commands in `charts/greenmail-kubernetes.yaml`, and to apply them run the following command in your terminal:

[source]
----
$ kubectl apply -f charts/greenmail-kubernetes.yaml --wait --timeout=10m0s
----

[NOTE]
====
When done with the quickstart, the `kubectl delete -f charts/greenmail-kubernetes.yaml` command may be used to revert the applied changes.
