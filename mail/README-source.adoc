[abstract]
The `mail` quickstart demonstrates how to send and receive emails using CDI and JSF and with custom Mail provider configured in {productName}.

:standalone-server-type: default

:restoreScriptName: remove-mail-session.cli
:openshift: true

== What is it?

The `mail` quickstart demonstrates sending and receiving emails with the use of _CDI_ (Contexts and Dependency Injection) and _JSF_ (JavaServer Faces) in {productNameFull}.

The mail provider is configured in the `mail` subsystem of the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` configuration file if you are running a standalone server or in the `__{jbossHomeName}__/domain/configuration/domain.xml` configuration file if you are running in a managed domain.

You can use the default mail provider that comes out of the box with {productName}. It uses your local mail relay and the default SMTP port of 25. However, this quickstart demonstrates how to define and use a custom mail provider.

This example is a web application that takes `To`, `From`, `Subject`, and `Message Body` input and sends mail using SMTP. These emails can be later read by using IMAP or POP3. The front end is a JSF page with a simple POJO backing, leveraging CDI for resource injection.

== Configure a Mail Server on Your Local Machine

To run the Mail Quickstart, you need a Mail Server configured with the following protocols and ports:

- SMTP port:1025
- POP3 port:1110
- IMAP port:1143

In addition, the Mail Subsystem configuration and the test cases expect you have the following Mail accounts configured on your Mail Server:

- user01@mail.local
- user02@mail.local

You can use any Mail Server you consider, although to facilitate this task, you will find under the Mail Quickstart root directory a docker compose file prepared to launch a Greenmail mail server with all the required configuration.
You will need to have installed a Container Engine capable of working with Docker compose files and Linux images.
The following command assumes you have https://podman.io/[Podman] and https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html[Podman Compose] installed in your local environment.

To launch the Greenmail server, open the terminal and navigate to the Mail Quickstart root directory and execute the following:

[source, bash]
----
$ podman compose up --wait
>>>> Executing external compose provider "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose". Please refer to the documentation for details. <<<<
----

Once you have finished with the Mail Quickstart, you can shutdown and remove the Greenmail server with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ podman compose down --volumes
>>>> Executing external compose provider "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose". Please refer to the documentation for details. <<<<

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

You configure the custom mail session in {productName} by running Management CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-mail-session.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-mail-session.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script creates custom outbound socket binding port for SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. It then creates the custom `MyOtherMail` mail session and configures it to use the custom outbound socket binding ports and default user credentials for SMTP and IMAP.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-mail-session.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

The following `outbound-socket-binding` groups are added to the `standard-sockets` `<socket-binding-group>` element.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<socket-binding-group name="standard-sockets" default-interface="public" port-offset="${jboss.socket.binding.port-offset:0}">
  ...
  <outbound-socket-binding name="my-imap-binding">
      <remote-destination host="localhost" port="1143"/>
  </outbound-socket-binding>
  <outbound-socket-binding name="my-pop3-binding">
      <remote-destination host="localhost" port="1110"/>
  </outbound-socket-binding>
  <outbound-socket-binding name="my-smtp-binding">
     <remote-destination host="localhost" port="1025"/>
  </outbound-socket-binding>
</socket-binding-group>
----

The `MyOtherMail` mail session is added to the `mail` subsystem and configured to use the custom outbound socket binding ports.

[source,xml,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="{MailSubsystemNamespace}">
   <mail-session name="default" jndi-name="java:jboss/mail/Default">
      <smtp-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="mail-smtp"/>
   </mail-session>
   <mail-session name="MyOtherMail" debug="true" jndi-name="java:jboss/mail/MyOtherMail">
     <smtp-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="my-smtp-binding" username="user01@mail.local" password="1234"/>
     <pop3-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="my-pop3-binding"/>
     <imap-server outbound-socket-binding-ref="my-imap-binding" username="user02@mail.local" password="1234"/>
   </mail-session>
</subsystem>

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/[http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/^].

NOTE: If you see `Error processing request` in the browser when you access the application and attempt to send email, followed by `jakarta.servlet.ServletException: MailConnectException: Couldn&#39;t connect to host, port: localhost, 1025; timeout -1; nested exception is: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`, make sure you followed the instructions above to xref:configure_an_smtp_server_on_your_local_machine[Configure an SMTP Server on Your Local Machine].
