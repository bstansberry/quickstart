[abstract]
The `helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured` quickstart demonstrates securing a Web application using client certificate authentication with authorization

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war
:restoreScriptName: restore-configuration.cli
:app-user-groups: JBossAdmin

== What is it?

This example demonstrates the configuration of _mutual TLS authentication_ in {productNameFull} {productVersion} to secure a war application.

Mutual TLS provides the same security as TLS, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server would request the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must obtain and maintain a digital certificate. We can secure our war application deployed over {productName} with mutual(two-way) client certificate authentication and provide access permissions or privileges to legitimate users.

The out of the box configuration for {productName} has one-way TLS enabled by default. This quickstart shows how to configure {productName} with mutual (two-way) TLS authentication in order to secure a WAR application with restricted access.

IMPORTANT: For the purpose of this quickstart the password can contain any valid value because the `ApplicationRealm` will be used for authorization only, for example, to obtain the security roles.

[[set_up_client_keystore_using_java_keytool]]
== Set Up the Client Keystore

. Create the client certificate, which is used to authenticate against the server when accessing a resource through TLS.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+", options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-client-cert.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

The certificate and keystore are now properly configured.

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

You configure the SSL context and required security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing __{jbossHomeName}__ with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `key-store` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store name="qsTrustStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>
    <file path="server.truststore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
</key-store>
----

. The following `trust-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<trust-managers>
    <trust-manager name="qsTrustManager" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>
</trust-managers>
----

. The default `ssl-context` was updated to reference the `trust-manager` to enable two-way TLS:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<server-ssl-contexts>
    <server-ssl-context name="applicationSSC" need-client-auth="true" key-manager="applicationKM" trust-manager="qsTrustManager"/>
</server-ssl-contexts>
----

+
Note that the `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem references the `applicationSSC` `server-ssl-context` by default.

. The following realms were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store-realm name="KeyStoreRealm" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>

<aggregate-realm name="QuickstartRealm" authentication-realm="KeyStoreRealm" authorization-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
----
+
The `aggregate-realm` defines different security realms for authentication and authorization. In this case, the `KeyStoreRealm` is responsible for authenticating the principal extracted from the client's certificate and the `ApplicationRealm` is responsible for obtaining the roles required to access the application.

. The following `principal-decoder` and `security-domain` were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<x500-attribute-principal-decoder name="QuickstartDecoder" attribute-name="cn"/>

<security-domain name="QuickstartDomain" default-realm="QuickstartRealm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper" principal-decoder="QuickstartDecoder">
    <realm name="QuickstartRealm" role-decoder="groups-to-roles"/>
</security-domain>
----
+
The `x500-attribute-principal-decoder` creates a new `Principal` from the CN attribute of the `X500Principal` obtained from the client's certificate. This new principal is supplied to the security realms and is also the principal returned in methods like `getUserPrincipal` and `getCallerPrincipal`.

. The following `http-authentication-factory` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-authentication-factory name="quickstart-http-authentication" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="QuickstartDomain">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="CLIENT_CERT"/>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
----
+
It defines the security domain that will handle requests using the `CLIENT_CERT` HTTP mechanism.

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `undertow` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="client_cert_domain" http-authentication-factory="quickstart-http-authentication"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
It maps the `client_cert_domain` from the quickstart application to the `http-authentication-factory` shown above, so requests made to the application go through the configured HTTP authentication factory.

[[test_the_server_ssl_configuration]]
== Test the Server TLS Configuration

To test the TLS configuration, start {productName} and access: https://localhost:8443

If it is configured correctly, you should be asked to trust the server certificate.

[[import_the_client_certificate_into_your_browser]]

// Build and Deploy the Quickstart
include::../shared-doc/build-and-deploy-the-quickstart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Additional deployment information
If mutual TLS is configured properly and the WAR application is secured, you will be able to access the application only if the DN of client certificate, for example `client.keystore.p12`, is same as the one defined in `app-roles.properties` file. Otherwise, it will result in an HTTP error status code of `403 Access Denied/Forbidden`.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: https://localhost:8443/{artifactId}

A page displaying the caller principal and the client certificate used for mutual TLS should be visible:
